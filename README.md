**ØG App**

ØG App is a Unity project for a gamified domestic task app made for individuals with ASD at Østre Gasværk, with Google Firestore integration. 
It is designed to be built for Android and iOS, and can also run in the Unity Editor (there may be problems accessing the webcam for photo tasks).

Creating a user involves choosing whether you are a resident or staff.

Residents can:
- Complete available tasks by taking a photo or writing an answer
- Earn rewards and spend them on upgrading a virtual pet
- Check the weekly schedule
- Access a leaderboard

Staff can:
- Verify completed tasks
- Create new tasks for residents
- Check the status of each resident or all at once
- Edit the weekly schedule
- Access a leaderboard

(To register as staff, a password is required. The password is 9827.)
